Resources for Mentors
=====================

Thank you for signing up to mentor at the mentored sprint for diverse beginners at PyCon US.
We're pleased to welcome you to the sprint.

The mentored sprint will take place on **16th - 17th of May 2020 online**.

Some useful information:
-------------------------

- The mentored sprint is organized as part of PyCon US online initiatives. Pre-registration to the event is required.

- We're excited that numerous projects and mentors have signed up for the sprint! Each project will have the opportunity to pitch for their own project to the group. Please be prepared with a **3-minute pitch**. Feel free to bring a slide (or two) with more details about you and the projects you are mentoring for if you feel like it. **Please
  send us the link to your Google Slides one day in advance.**

- We understand that setting up a local environment can be time-consuming, and the steps can vary from one project to another. To help the event more successful, we recommend that you include detailed setup instruction in your project's contributing guidelines before the event. This will give the attendees enough time to get set up before the sprint.

- We also recommend that you prepare at least **5 beginner-friendly issues** to be worked on during the sprint. Here are some ideas to get you started:

  * Identify problems that require low-effort involvement (i.e. it will take no more than
    a couple of hours to complete).

  * Get creative: select both coding and non-coding issues to work on the day (i.e. design a
    logo, add sections to the docs, help create a schematic) this will make your project more
    accessible and inclusive for the sprinters.

  * Label the issues accordingly on your issue tracker (i.e. beginner-friendly, good-first
    the issue, whatever style you follow).

By attending the mentored sprint at PyCon, you are also accepting to uphold PyCon and
the PSF'sPSF's code of conduct. Please take a moment to read it through at

Thank you again for your time to mentor! We are grateful for your work in open source and Python.
