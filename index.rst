About the sprints
-----------------

Open source projects such as Python and its multiple stacks(web, scientific, etc.)
are nothing but a collaborative effort from many community members. It is the
constant involvement of the numerous maintainers, contributors, and users that
make open-source software sustainable and keeps the community as a whole going.

Walking the path from user to collaborator, and thus contributing to an open-source project, can sometimes be intimidating especially for newcomers. From a
technical perspective, interacting with web-based hosting services (such as
GitHub, GitLab, etc.), branching and opening pull requests can be overwhelming
if these are not everyday actions of your workflow. The correctness of the
code and potential bugs are other common obstacles and fears any newcomer
might face. Not to mention the time and frustration accumulated over the task of
finding a 'beginner-friendly' issue to work on.

We also recognise that some groups are traditionally underrepresented in the
open-source community, and we would like to support them in their open-source path.
For these reasons, we are running for the second time the PyCon mentored sprints for
individuals from underrepresented groups willing to start contributing to Python
projects. This event will provide a supportive, friendly, and safe environment
for all the attendees and partner open source projects.

To achieve this goal, we are seeking to work with several Python projects
and their maintainers interested in providing mentorship
to these individuals. In return, we will provide guidance and advice on how to
prepare the projects for the day and to better serve a diverse range of contributors.


Why do we need a mentored sprint when we already run sprints within PyCon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PyCon sprints certainly offer an excellent opportunity to get contributors
and developers together and to squash several bugs in a relatively short
time. However, with this happening at the end of the event many
people, particularly less experienced developers, are not able to stay around
for this additional time, or cannot easily justify attending an event for an
an extra day or two. Also, a good amount of the people that attend the
sprints are often comfortable doing so and in many cases have made multiple
contributions to open source before or are, in fact, developers or maintainers
of open-source projects.

This mentored sprint focuses on providing less experienced developers with a
supportive environment in which they can learn, collaborate, expand their
network, and celebrate their victories at the end of it.

Furthermore, it serves as an excellent opportunity for some open source
projects to get some practical advice around inclusion and how to serve a
global and diverse pool of contributors. And perhaps establish longer-term
mentor-mentee or contributor relationships.


What projects will you be sprinting on?
---------------------------------------

PyCon US is the biggest Python conference organised every year, thousands of
developers, teachers, maintainers, and aficionados attend the event every year.
As such, it provides a unique opportunity to bring together creators,
maintainers, and users for a few days.

By running similar events in smaller conferences, we have learned that the
attendees (and projects) get much more out of it by having maintainers,
organisers and attendees working together. This way the maintainers of
a particular package can provide directed, effective and in-person mentoring to a
group of individuals and the attendees feel more confident and usually leave
with a higher sense of accomplishment.
